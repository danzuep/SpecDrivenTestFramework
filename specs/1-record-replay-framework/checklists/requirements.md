# Specification Quality Checklist: Minimal Record-Replay Testing Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-04
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed
 - [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
 - [x] Focused on user value and business needs
 - [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
 - [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
 - [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

 - [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
 - [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
 - [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Validation result: ALL CHECKS PASSED

Notes:
- The spec was edited to remove explicit language examples to avoid
	implementation detail leakage. Assumptions are documented in the spec.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were required.
